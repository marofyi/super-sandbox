# The Intelligence Economy 2026+

An interactive learning experience exploring how large language models are restructuring the internet economy.

## Vision

The internet economy rested on an implicit bargain: **users get free content, creators get traffic, platforms get ad revenue**. LLMs are unwinding this deal—not through malice, but through a fundamental shift in how information flows.

This isn't the hysterical "AI will destroy everything" narrative. It's more subtle and more interesting: **value is migrating upstream** while the infrastructure that created that value is being defunded.

## Core Thesis

We are witnessing a **value extraction event**, not a "transition."

- AI companies generate ~$15B+ ARR from models trained largely on scraped content
- Total licensing payments to content creators: ~$500M
- The ratio speaks for itself

## The Four Feedback Loops

### Loop 1: The Traffic Drain

```
AI Overviews appear in search
        ↓
Click-through rate drops 47%
        ↓
Publisher ad revenue falls
        ↓
Content investment shrinks
        ↓
Less quality content created
        ↓
AI has less to cite/summarize
```

### Loop 2: The Content Collapse (Model Collapse)

```
Human content creation slows
        ↓
AI trains on more AI-generated content
        ↓
Model quality degrades over generations
        ↓
AI outputs become less useful/accurate
        ↓
Users trust AI less... but still don't click through
```

Research: [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07566-y) - "AI models collapse when trained on recursively generated data"

### Loop 3: The Knowledge Commons Erosion

```
Stack Overflow questions drop 76%
        ↓
Developer knowledge base shrinks
        ↓
Edge cases and nuances undocumented
        ↓
Future AI training data degrades
        ↓
Coding assistance quality plateaus
        ↓
Developers have nowhere to turn for novel problems
```

### Loop 4: The Paywall Spiral

```
Ad revenue falls (down 33% since 2019)
        ↓
Publishers add/strengthen paywalls
        ↓
57% of users bounce at paywall
        ↓
Less freely accessible quality content
        ↓
AI can't access paywalled sources
        ↓
Users get worse answers from AI
        ↓
But publishers still don't get traffic
```

## Winners & Losers Matrix

### Clear Winners

| Entity | Mechanism | Evidence |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Google** | Monetizing AI Overviews at similar rates to traditional search | $54B Q1 2025, +13% YoY |
| **OpenAI** | Subscription + API revenue, trained on others' content | $10B ARR, 800M weekly users |
| **Anthropic** | Enterprise focus, code generation dominance | $5B ARR, 42% code gen market |
| **Reddit** | Data licensing deals, IPO timing | $203M in licensing revenue |

### Clear Losers

| Entity | Mechanism | Evidence |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Chegg** | Direct replacement by ChatGPT for homework help | -99% market cap, -31% subscribers |
| **Stack Overflow** | Developers asking AI instead of community | -76% questions, -50% traffic |
| **Travel blogs** | AI Overviews answer trip planning queries | The Planet D: -90% traffic, shutdown |
| **SEO content farms** | Low-value content now generated by AI for free | Commoditized to zero |

### Struggling to Adapt

| Entity | Challenge | Current State |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| **News publishers** | Traffic down, paywalls not scaling | 77% pivoting to subscriptions |
| **Freelance writers** | Rates collapsing, AI augmentation required | Adapting or exiting |
| **Educational platforms** | AI provides instant tutoring | Pivoting to credentialing |

### The Uncomfortable Middle

| Entity | Situation |
|--------|-----------|
| **Content creators** | Being scraped for training, seeing minimal licensing revenue |
| **Journalists** | Profession hollowing out, 78% job decline since peak |
| **The "open web"** | Traffic draining to zero-click, paywalls, and walled gardens |

## The Copyright Question

### Current Legal Landscape

- **40+ pending lawsuits** over AI training data usage
- **Thomson Reuters v. Ross Intelligence**: Court ruled training on copyrighted works is NOT fair use when commercial and non-transformative
- **US Copyright Office (May 2025)**: Using "vast troves" of copyrighted works for competing commercial products "goes beyond established fair use boundaries"

### The Licensing Tension

AI companies argue: "Training is transformative, like human learning"
Creators argue: "You're building commercial products on our work without payment"

The emerging licensing market ($5,000/book, $60M/year for Reddit) is **undermining the fair use defense**—if there's a market, you should have paid.

### Key Lawsuits

| Plaintiff | Defendant | Status |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| New York Times | OpenAI, Microsoft | Ongoing |
| New York Times | Perplexity | Filed Dec 2025 |
| News Corp (WSJ, NY Post) | Perplexity | Filed Oct 2024 |
| Getty Images | Stability AI | Ongoing |
| Authors Guild | OpenAI | Ongoing |
| Yomiuri/Asahi/Nikkei | Perplexity | Seeking $45M |

## Interactive Experience Design

### Primary Visualization: The Value Flow

A dual-path Sankey diagram showing where $1 of "information value" flows:

**Traditional Web (2019)**
```
User Query ($1)
    → Google (keeps $0.30 via ads)
    → Publisher (gets $0.50 via ads)
    → Creator (gets $0.15 from publisher)
    → Hosting/infra (gets $0.05)
```

**LLM-First Web (2025)**
```
User Query ($1)
    → LLM Provider (keeps $0.85 via subscription)
    → Licensing pool (gets $0.10)
    → Publishers (split $0.04)
    → Creators (get $0.01)
```

### Interactive Controls

1. **Query Split Slider (0-100% to LLMs)**
   - Adjusts the balance between traditional and LLM paths
   - Shows real-time revenue redistribution
   - Based on actual zero-click data

2. **Timeline Scrubber (2019-2026)**
   - Key events:
     - Nov 2022: ChatGPT launch
     - May 2024: AI Overviews rollout
     - 2024: Chegg collapse, Stack Overflow decline accelerates
     - 2025: Publisher lawsuits proliferate

3. **Stakeholder Health Meters**
   - Google: Green (monetizing AI Overviews effectively)
   - LLM Providers: Green (explosive growth)
   - Publishers: Yellow → Red (traffic declining)
   - Creators: Red (value extraction)
   - Knowledge Commons: Yellow → Red (contribution declining)

4. **Feedback Loop Visualizer**
   - Animate the four loops
   - Show cascade effects when thresholds are crossed
   - "Model collapse" warning when AI content exceeds human content

### Educational Panels

Each with expandable "dig deeper" sections:

1. **"The Implicit Bargain"**
   - How the ad-supported web worked for 25 years
   - The traffic-for-content exchange

2. **"The Zero-Click Trap"**
   - Why answering in-SERP breaks the model
   - The 83% zero-click rate with AI Overviews

3. **"The Chegg Canary"**
   - First major casualty: -99% market cap
   - Pattern for education, reference, how-to sectors

4. **"Model Collapse"**
   - The Nature study on recursive training
   - Why human content is irreplaceable

5. **"The Stack Overflow Paradox"**
   - AI learned from SO, now replacing it
   - What happens when the knowledge commons dies?

6. **"Who Pays for Training Data?"**
   - The copyright lawsuits
   - The emerging licensing market
   - Fair use vs. commercial exploitation

7. **"The Reddit Play"**
   - How Reddit monetized its position
   - Data licensing as the new content business model

---

## Design Principles

### Tone
- **Clear-eyed, not alarmist** — Present facts, let users draw conclusions
- **No villains** — Incentive structures, not evil actors
- **Acknowledge complexity** — Google still drives 90% of referrals
- **Pose hard questions** — What's the sustainable equilibrium?

### Visual Style
- Clean, minimal, professional
- Dark/light mode support
- Data-forward with source citations
- Animated transitions for flow visualization

### Technical Approach
- Single HTML file with embedded CSS/JS
- No build step, no dependencies beyond CDN
- SVG for flow diagrams
- CSS animations for money/attention flows
- ~800-1000 lines

## Open Questions for the User

The experience should leave users pondering:

1. **If AI defunds the content it learned from, what happens to future AI quality?**

2. **Is the licensing market ($500M) proportional to the value extracted ($15B+ ARR)?**

3. **What happens to specialized knowledge when Stack Overflow dies?**

4. **Can journalism survive on subscriptions alone if ad revenue keeps falling?**

5. **Is "free content for traffic" dead as a business model?**

6. **Who should pay for the training data that powers AI?**
