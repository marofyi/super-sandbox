            Task: Keep documentation up to date based on pull request changes.

            ## Step 1: Analyze changes

            Run: git diff origin/main...HEAD --name-only

            Understand what changed in this PR.

            ## Step 2: Update relevant documentation

            Based on the changes, update the appropriate docs:

            ### README.md
            - Update project/package descriptions if they changed
            - Add new projects or packages if created
            - Keep descriptions to 2-3 sentences with key technologies

            ### AGENTS.md
            - Update commands table if build/test commands changed
            - Update project structure if directories added/removed
            - Update environment variables if new ones required
            - Update workflow instructions if processes changed
            - **Maintain Agent Skills table**: If skills in `.skills/` were added, removed, or modified:
              - Read each `.skills/*/SKILL.md` file to extract `name`, `description`, and `allowed-tools` from YAML frontmatter
              - Update the "Agent Skills" table to reflect current skills
              - Keep table sorted alphabetically by skill name
              - Link each skill name to its SKILL.md file

            ### docs/learnings-log.md
            - Add new entries for significant discoveries or gotchas found during the PR
            - Document any non-obvious solutions or workarounds
            - Include date headers (YYYY-MM format)
            - Keep entries concise but informative for future reference

            ### Other docs (docs/*.md)
            - Update architecture docs if system design changed
            - Update deployment docs if deploy process changed
            - Update package docs if package APIs changed

            ## Step 3: Commit changes

            If you made documentation changes, commit them:
            git add README.md AGENTS.md docs/ && git commit -m "docs: update documentation for PR changes"

            ## Rules

            - Be concise and factual
            - Preserve existing document structure
            - Only update docs that are affected by the PR changes
            - Skip if documentation is already accurate
            - Do not add speculative or placeholder content

      - name: Cleanup override file
        run: rm -f AGENTS.override.md

      - name: Push changes
        run: |
          BRANCH="${{ github.head_ref || inputs.branch || github.ref_name }}"
          if [ -n "$(git log origin/${BRANCH}..HEAD 2>/dev/null)" ]; then
            git push origin HEAD:${BRANCH}
          fi
