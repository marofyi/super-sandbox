            Task: Update projects/index.html to reflect changes in the projects folder.

            ## Step 1: Analyze project changes

            Run: git diff origin/main...HEAD --name-only -- projects/

            Understand what projects were added, modified, or removed.

            ## Step 2: Update projects/index.html

            Scan the projects folder and update the index.html landing page:

            - Scan `projects/` for subdirectories with `package.json` (full projects)
            - Scan `projects/` for standalone `.html` files (prototypes, excluding index.html)
            - For each project, extract:
              - **Title**: from package.json `name` field or HTML `<title>` tag
              - **Description**: from package.json `description` or first paragraph in README.md
              - **Live URL**: from existing Vercel deployments or relative path for static HTML
              - **Type**: "Web Application", "CLI Tool", or "Prototype"
            - Update the HTML cards in the appropriate section (Web Applications, CLI Tools, Prototypes)
            - Preserve the existing HTML structure and Tailwind CSS classes
            - Add new project cards following the existing card template pattern
            - Remove cards for deleted projects

            ## Step 3: Commit changes

            If you made changes, commit them:
            git add projects/index.html && git commit -m "docs: update projects index"

            ## Rules

            - Be concise and factual
            - Preserve existing HTML structure and styling
            - Only update if projects were actually added, removed, or modified
            - Skip if index.html is already accurate
            - Do not add speculative or placeholder content

          if [ -n "$(git log origin/${BRANCH}..HEAD 2>/dev/null)" ]; then
